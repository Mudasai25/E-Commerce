                    Arguably the most well-known watch brand, Rolex has many firsts under its belt, among them the first-ever waterproof watch, appropriately called the Oyster, which was created in 1926.<br>Rolex watches have been worn to some of the most remote places on earth; into wild and challenging terrains, down into the depths of the ocean, and up onto lofty mountain peaks. If you needed proof that a Rolex isn’t just a fashion accessory, then this is it. 

                    The company was the first to patent a waterproof watch: the famous Oyster model.

                    Fine state-of-the-art craftsmanship is at the heart of every Montblanc timepiece, and especially in the Montblanc 1858 collection, which is a reinterpretation of 1920s and '30s Minerva watches used for military exploration.
                    Montblanc’s master craftsmen work diligently to create an exceptional range of timepieces in a diverse mix of styles, from the cutting-edge cool of the Timewalker collection to the ultra-luxurious Summit. 

                   <br>              Montblanc watches combine traditional Swiss Horlogerie skills with cutting-edge engineering.  With watches available for both men and women, Montblanc is now considered one of the most sophisticated watch brands out there.

                <p>
                    Georges-Édouard Piaget set up his first workshop on his family farm in the village of La Côte-aux-Fées in the Swiss mountains in 1874, launching the brand that is now famous for offering the thinnest automatic watch in the world.
                    Piaget is most famous for being a pioneer in ultra-thin watch calibers. This is the company behind both the world’s thinnest manual wind watch and the world’s thinnest automatic watch. Today, Piaget is known for its slim and pared-back designs—the last word in horological elegance. 

                   <br>               Piaget makes jewelry as well as watches and this might explain the brand’s innate grasp of aesthetics.

                    Louis-François Cartier founded the jewelry brand in Paris in 1847. Seventy years later, his grandson Louis Cartier invented the famous Tank Watch, which was modeled after a military tank. Several iconic watch models have followed since, including this Baignoire Allongée
                    In fact, today, Cartier’s range of luxury watches are some of the most celebrated timepieces on the market and the brand has established itself as a major player within the watch-making industry. 
<br>                   As a result, Cartier’s designs are often unusual with distinct configurations that set them apart from the crowd. The brand is best known for its ‘Tank’ range of watches—now considered iconic by many.

Nevertheless, the same spirit of innovation that drives the brand's fantastical gems also applies to its timepieces.

In the 1950s, it introduced the Fifty Fathoms diving watches, which were crafted in collaboration with the French Navy's combat swimmers and soon became the standard issue of the US Navy SEALs.

                    <br>            The brand is still exceptionally prestigious though, and you can be assured of the high quality of each watch thanks to the 1,000 Hour Test each one undergoes. This is a program of internal certification and includes movement testing before and after the casing of the watch. The 1,000 Hour Control engraving on the back of a JLC watch is guaranteed that it has passed this rigorous program.

                    Founded by childhood friends Jules-Louis Audemars and Edward-Auguste Piguet in 1875, Audemars Piguet is perhaps most famous for its Royal Oak collection, which since its debut in 1972, has become an obligatory status symbol for every A-lister from hip hop legends to elite athletes. Now it has some competition: In 2019, the brand released a new collection.
                    While not as much of a household name as Rolex, perhaps, Audemars Piguet offers something else to would-be wearers: a sense of exclusivity that can only come with being slightly under the radar. 

Effortlessly stylish, an AP watch is a demonstration of true creativity and artistry. While many wristwatch brands boast about their level of precision or incredible durability, AP pays just as much attention to impeccable finishes, intricate motifs, and eye-catching engravings.

                    Omega watches have traveled to the North Pole, been launched into space, and descended into the depths of the ocean in submarines. As a consequence, Omega has gained a reputation as one of the successful wristwatch brands in the world. 

                   
                    Since then, the pace of success has hardly slowed for Omega. Indeed, Omega watches have broken several precision records. At the 1931 Geneva observatory trials—nicknamed the Olympics of watchmaking—Omega came first place in all six categories.

                    The last family-owned independent watch manufacturer left in Geneva, the company was founded in 1839 and has remained in the hands of the Stern family since then. This continuity of ownership allows Patek Philippe to maintain its unique identity. The brand takes its creative freedom seriously. 

Indeed, it’s Patek Philippe’s unparalleled approach to design that has allowed the swiss manufacturer to achieve status as one of the best watch companies in the world.

                    Georges Favre-Jacot was just 22 when he founded his eponymous watch company in 1865, eventually renaming it Zenith. In the century and half since, the brand has amassed a number of high profile wearers, including Mahatma Gandhi.

                    "Techniques d'Avant Garde" is what the TAG in TAG Heuer has stood for since Edouard Heuer launched the Swiss brand in 1860. In 1962, John Glenn wore a Heuer stopwatch on the Mercury-Atlas 6 flight, giving the Swiss watchmaker the distinction of being the first in space. Now well-known for their sporty silhouettes, TAG Heuer has an illustrious list of celebrity ambassadors, both official and not, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Will Smith, Matt Damon, and Tom Brady.

                <p>
                    Founded as Officine Panerai in Florence in 1860, this Italian watchmaker has become known for its bold, sporty cases. From its former role as the official supplier to the Royal Italian Navy to its partnership with Ferrari, Panerai's timepieces guarantee the finest Italian craftsmanship.
                    Panerai’s best-known watches, however, are the Radiomir and the Luminor—both of which have been updated numerous times to take advantage of new technology. The aesthetic has remained mostly the same, retaining that undeniably Panerai mood. 

                    <br>                    When it was released in 1938, the Radiomir was considered ground-breaking thanks to its use of radium-based powder to illuminate the dials. Meanwhile, the Luminor was made using a luminous tritium-based material.

                    Chopard is most famous within the watch industry for its Happy Diamonds Line, one of the company’s most highly-prized and recognizable collections, launched in 1976. <br>
